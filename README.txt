Introduction
------------

This project was part of my preparatory courses in the masters
degree.

It was basically required to port the SUMO ontology library to .NET

Instead of porting the actual library, this project makes use of IKVM
to convert the SUMO Java JAR into a .NET DLL.

Then the rest of the project is basically some nice wrappers around
this library to make it more convenient to .NET developers

This requires the SUMO knowledge base to be available
